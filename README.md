## Introduction

Designed with mobile viewing in mind, this is a variation of the project set forth by Turing School of Software and Design. [See rubric here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/travel-tracker.html).

Significant attempts were made to keep user preferences in mind while still maintaining DRY and empathetic code.

Updated: 2021/02/16

## Reflections

### Wins & Challenges

#### Wins
_Finishing up to Iteration 3_
_Having a Dark Mode_
_Finding different solutions for strange problems_

#### Challenges
There was a point I struggled with myself constantly because I felt as if because I wasn't on scheduled as planned and because of the constant snags and asking for help and getting stuck-- as if it didn't matter how much effort and detail I put into my projecy. That I wouldn't finish. My hardwork would remain unsung and only my failures would be acknowledged. Most of this is the result of already existing self-doubt that became heightened when in a high stress and high stakes venture.

For next time, though, when I find myself experiencing these feelings again, I hope to remember to look back on this project and remember my dedication, my hardwork, and my passion is what this showcased overall.

### Future Iterations

More specifics about future work or refactoring can be found in this projects [GH issues](https://github.com/gaj23/get-going-gone/issues).

Generally, though, I think the Traveler class needs a buffing to DRY it up. There is a method included that I never used (Issue #26) and some additional consideration could be put into if the object instantiation of Traveler should contain its own list of trips (Issue #26).

Although created and tested, the Destination class is never used. (Issue #27)

The site is responsive, but best viewed on a mobile device. I would like to apply media queries (Issue #28) to make the viewing more pleasing on a desktop or tablet. Priorities were given to functionality, general usability, and dark mode enablization.
